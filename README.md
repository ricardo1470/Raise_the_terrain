| 1. Rotation  | Rotate the grid when the user is using left or right arrows. Please use the `M_PI` macro defined in `math.h`. Link with the gcc `-m` flag to be able to use the math library. Here is the formula to apply a rotation to a point in 2D: The 2D point you want to rotate is defined with the coordinates [x, y]. The rotation angle `a` is calculated as follow: `a = Angle * PI / 180` `Angle` being the angle in degrees, and `a` the angle in radians.  `Rx = x * cos(a) - y * sin(a)` `Ry = x * sin(a) + y * cos(a)` |
